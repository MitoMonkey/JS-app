# Poked√©x app
An app to show a list of Pokemon from (https://pokeapi.co/)[https://pokeapi.co/] API, with a filter input and a modal to show details for each Pokemon.

This app was created as a study project during my Fullstack Webdeveloper course @CarrerFoundry.

## The study goals were to
* Created a list of pokemon as an object and implement functions to print the list to the console as well as add a new pokemon
* Substitut the list with data from an external API ((https://pokeapi.co/)[https://pokeapi.co/])
* Create DOM elements (a list of buttons) for each element from the API
* Manually create a modal and a dialog window that shows name, height and picture of a pokemon when clicked
* Integrate bootstrap and adapt all functions and styles (as well as creating a nav-bar and replacing the modal with the bootstrap template)
* Install node.js and npm via nvp to get ESLinter and Stylelinter up and running
* Fix all linting errors, minify JS and CSS files and organize them into the folders "src" and "dist"

# Development environment
